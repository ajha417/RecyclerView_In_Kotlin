        On a track that was difficult to bat on, as it has been at the Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow Super Giants eventually managed to score an impressive 177 for three in 20 overs in the IPL 2023 match against Mumbai Indians on Tuesday and much of the credit goes to the fabulous knock by Marcus Stoinis. The all-rounder smashed an unbeaten 89 off 47 en route to which LSG scored 54 runs in the final three overs to lift themselves to the score of 177. Captain Krunal Pandya too played a valiant knock which helped LSG revive the three early blows. However, he had walked off the field batting on 49 with an injury. (LSG vs MI Live Score, IPL 2023)
